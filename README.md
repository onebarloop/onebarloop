You found me on GitHub - awesome!

My name is Alex and right now learning to code!

So far I have gotten into:

- Python
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- React

When I am not glued to the monitor I love producing electronic music, tinkering with arduino and raspberry and meet up with friends for a hike or a drink
