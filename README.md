<h1 align="center">You found me on GitHub - awesome!</h1>
<br>

### My name is Alex and I just finished a three months WebDev-bootcamp [@neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/)
<br>
 
**So far I have gotten into:**
```python
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
 -TypeScript
- React
- Next.js
- Node.js
- Astro 🚀🧑‍🚀
 ```
 
You are welcome to check my public repos. Please keep in mind, that most of them are practice-projects. Therefore they are often not finished. You can find my **capstone-project** [here](https://github.com/onebarloop/capstone-project)

When I am not glued to the monitor I love producing electronic music, tinkering with arduino and raspberry, mentoring young kids [@jugend hackt](https://www.jugendhackt.org) and meet up with friends for a hike or a drink. I don't like Harry Potter.
