 ## <p align="center">You found me on GitHub - awesome!</p>

### My name is Alex and right now I am learning to code in a three months bootcamp [@neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/)
<br>
 
**So far I have gotten into:**

- Python
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- React


When I am not glued to the monitor I love producing electronic music, tinkering with arduino and raspberry, mentoring young kids [@jugend hackt](https://www.jugendhackt.org) and meet up with friends for a hike or a drink. I don't like Harry Potter.
